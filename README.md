## Variables

To declare a variable that its value can change over time, use the `var` keyword:  

```Swift
var name = "An"
name = "Tuan"
``` 
But, to declare a variable that can be set value once and never change it, we use `let` keyword:  
  
```Swift
let taylor = "swift"
``` 
## Data Type 
__1. Integer__    
To hold a whole number, Swift assigns the type `Int` - short for "interger".  

```Swift
var population = 8_000_000
var age = 38
```
__2. Double__
"Double" holds fractional values such as 38.1, or 3.141592654. And it can hold a big number. 

```Swift
var pi = 3.141
```
__3. Float__
"Double" holds fractional values. But it just can hold a small number.

```Swift
var floatNum = 1.2
```
